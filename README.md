# Intelligent Mathematics
## "Intelligent Mathematics" Maths-Computer Science Presentation

In February 2016, we submitted a presentation for the Annual Conference of Sciences that was held in Paphos, Cyprus that year.
Our team was composed by:
  - Angelos Pelecanos (me)
  - Andrianos Michael
  - Evripidis Papaevripidis
  
Our presentation's subject was the intersection of mathematics and informatics/computer science and the many applications in this area.

### More specifically, we divided our presentation into 4 of the main areas of Mathematics:
  * **Algebra:**
    - Solving simultaneous equations using *Gaussian Elimination* in O(N^3)
    - Using *numerical methods* for approximating solutions
  
  * **Combinatorics:**
    - Important problems in *Graph Theory* such as Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree, which have many applications in modern networks
    - *Matrices* and how every operation can be implemented in code
    - *Dynamic Programming* as a problem solving paradigm, related to recurrent relations
  
  * **Number Theory:**
    - We demonstrated some ways of *Prime Testing* with different complexities
    - Using these we then concluded to *Prime Factorization* of integers, with many important applications in modern cryptography
  
  * **Geometry:**
    - Implemented and demonstrated the *Convex Hull algorithm*
    - Also showed how *cartesian geometry* can be easily implemented and used to solve problems by code

  * We additionally offered some basic information about *complexity* and the importance of complexity analysis in these applications.
